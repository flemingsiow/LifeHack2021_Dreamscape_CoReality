# LifeHack2021_Dreamscape_CoReality
Welcome! We are a team of Year 2 students from Singapore Polytechnic, consisting of Fleming Siow, Le Jie and Hong Shun. We are excited to share with all of you our product to help tackle the problems posed by the Covid-19 pandemic on Education. 

## Description
### What's the problem?
> The Covid-19 pandemic has introduced uncertainty into major aspects of national and global society, including schools. As the virus continues to rampage across the world, making informed decisions about whether and when to return to in-person teaching remains challenging and dangerous.

### How can technology help?
> As technology rapidly infiltrates the education sector, it has not only brought out changes to the way students learn, but also how teachers teach. In order to make learning and/or teaching more safe for everyone, while still making lessons exciting and effective, it will require a controlled and good use of technology and practices.

### Our solution
> Our solution, CoReality, allows schools, universities or institutions to easily create a unified user interface for students and teachers to interact across different courses. Furthermore, with Virtual Reality (VR) technology, we were able to create a visual workspace such as a classroom or meeting room using 360° cameras to record the area and streamed through the Internet. This creates a unique and immersive experience for students and teachers to converse and learn online all while at the comforts of their home—safe from the virus.
